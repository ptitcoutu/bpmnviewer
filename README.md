bpmnviewer
==========

BPMN 2.0 Web Viewer (using only HTML 5, SVG and JS).
This is for the moment a study around the ability to draw BPMN Diagram 
using d3.js and angular.js


Aims and motivations
--------------------------

 1. **Multiples diagrams on bpmn semantics** : For the moment no web viewer and/or editor could load bpmn with no or several diagrafs on a process semantics. The diagram is often unique and is purely the unique graphical representation of the semantic.
 2. **Correct BPMN validation** : BPMN needs to be correctly interpreted. The interpretation of definitions errors should provide enough information to diagnose and adapt consequently the file.
 3. **Easy to integrate and deploy**
 4. **Extendable and open**
